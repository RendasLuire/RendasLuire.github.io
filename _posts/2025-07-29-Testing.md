This post is about **testing**. As developers, we need to test our software â€” this becomes even more important when the software is expected to grow and be maintained over time.

One of the first questions I asked myself was:  
**How much should I test my software?**

While reading about this topic, I found that there are mainly two types of tests: **unit tests** and **integration tests**.

### ðŸ§ª Integration Tests

Integration tests are used to test a complete workflow or a group of components working together. For example, in backend development â€” particularly with REST APIs â€” we can test each endpoint to ensure the entire request/response cycle works correctly, even after we introduce changes or add new features.

The goal here is to validate that different parts of the system interact properly. These tests often use tools like `supertest` in Node.js or `pytest` with Flask/Django in Python.

### ðŸ”¬ Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual functions or components. Each function should behave correctly on its own. The idea is that if every small part works well independently, the whole system will be more stable and easier to debug.

Frameworks like `jest`, `mocha`, or `vitest` (in JavaScript/TypeScript) are commonly used for this purpose.

### ðŸ’¡ A Realistic Perspective

In real-world scenarios, especially when you're working alone or in a small team, it's not always realistic to write comprehensive unit tests for everything. Sometimes, you're lucky if you manage to write some good integration tests.

But even partial testing is better than none. Automated tests help you catch bugs early, give you confidence when refactoring, and can save hours of manual testing in the long run.

The key is to find a balance â€” test what matters most, especially core business logic and any parts of your application that are complex or critical.

### Final Thoughts

Iâ€™m still learning and improving in this area, but understanding the difference between types of tests and when to apply them is already helping me write better and more maintainable code.

Next, I plan to explore **end-to-end (E2E)** testing and maybe experiment with tools like Cypress or Playwright.

Letâ€™s keep learning.
